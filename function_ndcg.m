%NDCG   Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
%   NDCG(pred_relevance, y) returns nDCG, where pred_relevance is the true 
%   graded relevance of all results in the search result list (the vector 
%   has to be sorted by the estimated relevance in the descending order)  
%   and y is a vector of all relevances in the corpus (it does not have to 
%   be in any particular order as it is automatically sorted).
% 
%   This is a straightforward implementation of nDCG measure as described
%   at Wikipedia. No attempt was made to accelerate the function (e.g.
%   by caching the optimal ranking or by precomputing the logarithms).
%   And no attempt was made to deal with ties (e.g. optimistic and 
%   pessimistic estimates are not provided).
% 
%   Example from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain:
%       pred_relevance = [3;2;3;0;1;2]; % High values mean higher relevance
%       y = [3;2;3;0;1;2;3;2];          % The relevance of the whole corpus 
%       ndcg(pred_relevance, y)         % We expect nDCG=0.785
% wiki_test = [3,2,3,0,1,2]';
% wiki_best = [3,3,2,2,1,0]';
% function_ndcg(wiki_test,wiki_best); %we expect nDCG = 0.961

    % nDCG is commonly calculated only for top k items, get the k.
    len = length(pred_relevance);
    % Get "Discounted Cumulative Gain" for the provided ranking.
    DCG = sum(pred_relevance./log2(1+(1:len))');
    % Get ideal ranking for the top k items.
    sorted = sort(y, 'descend');
    ideal = sorted(1:len);
    % Get "Discounted Cumulative Gain" for the ideal ranking.
    IDCG = sum(ideal./log2(1+(1:len))');
    % Get the normalized result.
